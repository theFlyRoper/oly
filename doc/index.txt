Current Features
----------------
* Internal node queue and string buffer
* Node hierarchy preserved and sent through
* Data source interface for external sources
* Boundary buffers to transfer external encodings/character sets to internal (ICU) encoding and back again.
* Storage for several different types of data in each node.
* SHA3 hash function built in and ready for use.
* Polyglot (that is, translatable) error handling

Wanted Features
---------------
. Internal YAML loading.  YAML will be a data source but built in to Oly.  Will load configuration.
. Configuration file loading and storage
. External node interface with char pointers
. Alias and anchor handling
. Use hashing for something; configuration index, maybe?
. Table data source input objects.  Columns, rows, tables, etc.

Problems
--------
. Remove unneeded data source and node functions.  Define clearer boundaries between these objects.
. String buffer has some problems.  Runs too many times.  Could use debugging.
. Bring doc and lib Makefile.am into main directory.
. Flesh out data source dequeue and extract functions.
. Remove unused errors.
. Do something with state.  Begin Oly scripting language work, perhaps?
. Organize functions in files better.
. Clean up core library.  All tests link to core, core is huge.  Lighten it.
. Verify destructor functions free all memory, and that they are called when they should be.
