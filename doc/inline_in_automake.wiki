<h2><a name="_the_problem"></a>1. The Problem</h2>
<p>I want to compile an inline static function with a
forward declaration, but keep the function itself in
a separate file.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/hello/">GNU Hello</a>, they
create static print_help and print_version functions.
These functions would not be usable in a bigger project;
even in GNU Hello they take up a lot of space.  I don&#8217;t
want to comb through main every time I add a new feature to
paste a new line into the help.  Good luck finding instructions
for building static functions in separate files, though.</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#e8e8e8" width="100%" cellpadding="4"><tr><td>

<p>Print_help.c and print_version.c contain static
function.  They are not <em>defined</em> as static, because they
would then not be visible after linking.  Go try it:
open up print_help.c and add "static" in front of void
at the function declaration.  GCC will complain.  However,
since these functions are only defined in main.c,
presumably when libtool links the files it inlines them.</p>
<p>/* interesting thing here.  Note that
 * these declarations can be static, as long
 * as the functions themselves are not declared
 * static. That is, these functions exist in
 * separate files, which are glued together by
 * the linker.  Unfortunately, gcc doesn&#8217;t like
 * inline static functions in separate files.
 * */</p>
<p>warning* about undefined functions. main.c declares the
functions in cleanenv,
close_stdout, print_version and print_help as static, but it
doesn&#8217;t like that they live in other files.  The little -w
flag disables all warnings.  I want the warnings ON for
the rest of the files, though.</p>
