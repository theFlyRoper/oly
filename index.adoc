Introduction
------------
Oly is a program designed to help move data between different storage media.  Ultimately, it will bridge relational/non-relational databases, spreadsheets, markup files and text files.  Oly is not intended as a storage medium itself, but rather as a way to move data around easily.

Project State
-------------
This repository has been around for a long time, and its creator, Jonathan Towne, learned a lot about structuring programs over time.  It has changed structure repeatedly and is not very readable as of 1-15-2016.  In short, do forgive the ugliness of this repo in its current state.  I hope to fix it up over the next few months.
